# Futility
Futility code to implement the SS-MIX-MEM approach borrowing from external RWCD to supplement RCT. 

functions.R houses functions used to run the simulations in Simulations.R 
the .cpp files are being used to run the SS-MIX-MEM steps more quickly in Cpp. 
Simulations_Code is example run of the TO and the SS-MIX-MEM simulations.
